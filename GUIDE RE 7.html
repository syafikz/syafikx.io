<p>Well, yes, this one is a bit of a cheat. You see, the Las Plagas removal laser you can unlock as a weapon is strictly non-canon. That machine Leon and Ashley use to remove their parasites during the game&rsquo;s climax? This tech is just a little more sophisticated than that.</p>
<p>Completing the game on Professional mode grants the player the P.R.L. 412 for subsequent playthroughs on that save file.&nbsp;<a href="https://screenrant.com/sci-fi-movies-most-hilarious-strangest-weapons-ever-ranked/">It&rsquo;s a very sci-fi looking weapon</a>&nbsp;that fires beams of light, in quick bursts or concentrated charged shots. It&rsquo;s capable of one-shotting just about everything in the game and boasts unlimited ammo (watch its charge level, though).</p>
