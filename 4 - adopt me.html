<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Tip 4: Sell Some Unwanted Items or Lemonade</h3>
<p>A good way to make a bit of extra cash is to sell some items or lemonade/hot dogs. If you are just beginning, this wouldn't be the best way to earn money until you have a few pets and vehicles that you would be willing to sell for money and a house that's Pizza Place or any house that is more expensive than that. If you want to sell items, you need to have a cash register, a house that is any house but Tiny Home (starter home) and Family Home, and items to sell. Have your shop setup ready, a good example would be the photo on the side. Make all of your items 100 Bucks or less. This is because many people might think you are scamming by making them pay more. So, it is just more safe and reliable, if you are&nbsp;<strong>GENUINELY</strong>&nbsp;trying to sell items and not scamming. Now on to how to sell lemonade/hot dogs. Anyone can do this if they have a lemonade stand or a hot dog stand. If you don't and have a little bit of Robux, you can buy a lemonade stand for&nbsp;<span class="basic-tooltip tooltips-init-complete"><strong>50</strong></span>&nbsp;and a hot dog stand for&nbsp;<span class="basic-tooltip tooltips-init-complete"><strong>90</strong></span>. You can then set up the stand my taking it out of your inventory (it's located in Toys) and placing it where ever you chose. I recommend placing it somewhere in the town center or near the tunnel, where lots of people see it for the maximum amount of money. You can bring it's starting price down (lemonade's starting price: 10 Bucks and hot dog stand's starting price: 20 Bucks) to a minimum of $1 for each and a maximum of 20 Bucks for lemonade and 50 Bucks for hot dogs.</p>
