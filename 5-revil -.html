<p><strong>So, yes. We&rsquo;ve already seen that Leon&rsquo;s humble combat knife really does a number on Krauser. Experienced players will also be aware of the simple, yet effective, handgun shot, melee, knife-knife-knife technique carries you surprisingly far through the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Only true experts, however, know how to really utilize this to its fullest. Enemy attacks tend to be very telegraphed, meaning that you can easily dodge, dash in to knife them, dodge out again and repeat. It&rsquo;s absolutely not practical in terms of damage, but you can stagger foes, cause them to drop their weapons and just defeat them outright with this technique most of the time, if you&rsquo;re patient</strong></p>
