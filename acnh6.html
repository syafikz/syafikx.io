<h2 id="81nriG"><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 6</strong></h2>
<p id="1oQq1N">Another freebie day. You should have another new villager in town, but outside of talking to them there won&rsquo;t be a lot of &ldquo;must-dos.&rdquo; Feel free to spend the day however you wish. Drowning in Nook Miles? Buy a ticket to a<strong>&nbsp;Nook Island</strong>, and maybe you&rsquo;ll luck out with some fruit you don&rsquo;t already have.</p>
<p id="7qWiOG">Or you can spend the day fishing and collecting bugs to build up your stash of Bells. It&rsquo;s really up to you!</p>

<h2 id="olQjmc"><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 7</strong></h2>
<p id="liG9D1">There&rsquo;s something&nbsp;<strong>big</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>happening on your island today. Yes, Tom Nook&rsquo;s boring ol&rsquo; tent is being transformed into a legit&nbsp;<strong>Resident Services</strong>&nbsp;building, with all sorts of new functionality added. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s going to take a couple days for the upgrade to happen.</p>
<p id="qi4Tal">Today it&rsquo;s mostly business as usual, but tomorrow the tent (as well as the ABD machine) will be fully inaccessible. Don&rsquo;t worry, the&nbsp;<strong>Nook Miles streak</strong>&nbsp;you get for accessing the ABD every day won&rsquo;t be broken during this time.</p>
<p id="CNiswl">The third and final housing plot should be filled today, so make sure you head over there and introduce yourself. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll appreciate all the effort you put in to get them set up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="7hX9eO">The big event on the horizon (which should happen on Day 9 if you&rsquo;ve been following this guide) is the opening of the new&nbsp;<strong>Resident Services</strong>&nbsp;building. Once that opens, you&rsquo;ll unlock the ability to build&nbsp;<strong>bridges</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ramps</strong>&nbsp;throughout your island for a hefty Bell charge.</p>
<p id="tlTjzW">After that, there are more events and buildings still to come, so be sure to keep checking back each day to see what the island has in store for you. Remember:&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>&nbsp;is a marathon, not a sprint, so even just 20 minutes per day should be plenty to get the basics done. Of course, if you want to go over that, we&rsquo;re certainly not stopping you.</p>
