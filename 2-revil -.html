<p><strong>Another thing that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>&nbsp;players have surely noticed is that rocket launchers are incredibly effective. You just point the boom-y end at who/whatever you want to take out, and they explode out of existence. They&rsquo;re in very short supply and don&rsquo;t come cheap, though, so you&rsquo;ve got to use them very sparingly (outside of the unlockable one with infinite ammo, naturally).</strong></p>
<p><strong>To get the best bang from your buck out of that single shot, you&rsquo;ll want to save it until your late-game encounter with Verdugo, Salazar&rsquo;s infamous &ldquo;right hand man.&rdquo; Near the end of the castle segment, this lightning-fast and nigh-invulnerable beast attacks you in an area littered with cans of liquid nitrogen. Simply &ldquo;use&rdquo; one of the cans when the creature is in range to temporarily freeze it in place. While it&rsquo;s immobilized, a single hit with the rocket launcher will defeat it.</strong></p>
