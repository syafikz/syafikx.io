<p>Naturally, you want the crew members to eject as many of their own as possible. But in early game especially, your priority is to build up your own credibility. Covering for another player may therefore be a wise move. A phrase like &ldquo;I think I saw pink complete a task, he is clear&rdquo; will make you look trustworthy. With any luck, the player you covered for will remember that and be less inclined to vote you out later in the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can be wise to save an innocent player from elimination. If you create a tie between two Crewmates, the next round is still all about them. The Crewmates are wasting Meetings while you remain in the clear.</p>
