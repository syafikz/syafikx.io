<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;">IVYWOOD MANOR</span></h1>

<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;">CREATED BY&nbsp;IMPACTYT</span></h4>

<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">MAP INFO</span></h2>
<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;">This map started as a survival project, but the idea was moved to a creative world after I realized the build's potential. This grand Manor is based off of old style British Manors/mansions (bonus points if you can find the one that most heavily inspired me), using the ornate detailing, use of depth, and floor plan patterns as the old buildings. The map itself has surrounding mountains, forests and gardens, and a full interior including a library, ballroom, grand lobby, two dining rooms, a kitchen, and many other assorted rooms like bedrooms, bathrooms, offices, lounges, and more. I experimented with some more intricate detailing on this map. and really tried to fill both the exterior and interior with as much detail as possible. I personally really love the aesthetic that was achieved, and hope you do too.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;">To play this map, I would suggest a medium-high render distance, but not quite maximum. I would also HEAVILY SUGGEST turning off command block messages (if you don't turn them off and wait for night time, you will see what I mean). On top of that, I generally encourage shaders to improve the experience, but they are definitely not mandatory. I personally use&nbsp;<a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sildurs Vibrant Shaders</strong></a>&nbsp;if you would like to download them.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;">When I think of some influences and people who have helped me evolve as a builder, I think of two people in particular. These two individuals are two builders that are both members of a building team I am currently on, named Xoyjaz and MrSpy321. Since joining the team, Xoyjaz has been very accommodating and overall taught me a great deal about building in general. MrSpy321 has taught me about how to establish character in my builds, ornate detailing, and a whole lot of building tricks that are used all over the place. Most all of the interior work is just me re-using things MrSpy321 has taught me, or aspects of his builds that I have noted and stolen :). My heart goes out to both of these incredible people for improving me.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #ffffff;">Thank you so much for checking out the project! If you like what you see, be sure to leave some love on this post :).</span></h4>
