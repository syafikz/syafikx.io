<p>When you first gained access to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>&rsquo;s shooting gallery minigame, you might have wandered in, tried out a round or two, then decided it was more trouble than it was worth and left. It can be a bit of a slog, after all, and the bottlecap figurines you can collect won&rsquo;t mean much to anyone other than completionists.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth sticking with, especially in a new game run when you want to pump every upgrade you can into your favorite weapons. In the menu, you&rsquo;ll notice that the bottlecap figures you collect are displayed in rows. You&rsquo;re rewarded a nice cash reward for every row you complete, and while it&rsquo;s not a huge amount, it&rsquo;s certainly worth the free money once a playthrough. If you&rsquo;re a good shot and always go for the bonus Salazar targets, it won&rsquo;t take long at all!</p>
