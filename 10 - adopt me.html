<p>Task Tips. This should be at the top of the list but I almost forgot about it. For Hunger, there are <strong>free apples at school</strong> at a Teacher's desk. There are also pet bowls at school but only pets can use them. There is also a drinking fountain for pets at the nursery. For Thirst, what I did back then was go inside each open home and see if they have a water cooler so I can swipe some free drinks but looking for them usually isn't worth the time so I recommend buying a <strong>water cooler [300 bucks]</strong>. If you want to save money, basic cribs are usable for both babies and pets. I think it's also worth investing in a <strong>piano [100 bucks]. It cures "bored" so you don't have to go all the way to the playground.</strong> For the "sick" task, I recommend just getting some <strong>healing apples on the Hospital</strong> so you can heal on the go.</p>

<p>Traveling Tips. If you want to go to the main area just click your <strong>bag&gt;gifts&gt;+&gt;teleport to gifts display</strong>. If you want to go to the Nursery and Baby Shop, just do the same thing in Toys and Pets. You don't need a magic door to go home easily! Just <strong>reset your character!</strong> But by doing so it will unequip your pet so just equip your pet immediately so you wouldn't miss out on tasks. The starter vehicle I recommend you guys buying is <strong>roller skates [300 BUCKS]</strong>. Cheap and very helpful to close travel like going to the campsite, etc.</p>
