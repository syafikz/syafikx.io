<p>When at least four players are standing on the same spot and one of them gets stabbed to death, it is very hard to determine who the killer was. You, as an Impostor, should make use of that.</p>
<p>So how do you get enough players in one place? As the numbers dwindle, it will be more and more difficult to find such a crowded area. But in early game you can, for example, sabotage the reactor. With some luck, many players will gather in the same spot to fix it. Pretend to be running to fix the reactor alongside them, wait a few seconds while everyone gets started, and then strike. Don&rsquo;t forget to act surprised!</p>
