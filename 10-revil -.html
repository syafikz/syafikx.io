<div>While Leon and his various lumpen enemies are much more mobile than anything the series had offered up to this point, their movements are still quite clunky.&nbsp; As we&rsquo;ve mentioned previously, though, this only means that enemies are easier to manipulate. Back in 2005, when you double-tapped the &ldquo;open door&rdquo; prompt to kick it open instead, stunning and knocking back the enemies that were trying to break it down, you felt like a true action hero.</div>

<div>You&rsquo;d be surprised how far you can push this concept. One canny player, YouTube&rsquo;s Dante Ravioli, has defeated the chainsaw-wielding miniboss (and even the deadly Verdugo) using only a door!</div>
