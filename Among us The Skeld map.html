<p>The spaceship map called &lsquo;The Skeld&rsquo; was the only map available upon the game&rsquo;s release. There are 14 rooms: two large ones in the middle and 6 smaller ones on the east and west sides. All the rooms are connected by corridors. Here are the key things to look out for:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The structure:&nbsp;</strong>due to its symmetry, The Skeld is easy to navigate around; there are only two corridors taking you from the left side to the right, and three to take you from the bottom to the top of the map (and vice versa).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>The vent system:&nbsp;</strong>as you can see in the picture, the 5 vent connections are easy to memorize as well. Just remember the two triangle shapes in the middle and the single lines in each corner. Except for the lower middle part, there will always be nearby vents for Impostors to use.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Visual tasks:&nbsp;</strong>The Skeld has 5 visual tasks, which is a lot. As a result, the odds of winning on The Skeld are better for Crewmates. The host can turn visual tasks off to fix this advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Sabotage locations:&nbsp;</strong>the four sabotage locations are equally spread across the map; they are at the Reactor, Electrical, Communications and O2 room. Remember that an Impostor can only lock the doors of the rooms on the left side (except for the Reactor room) and in the middle of the map. By using these features, it is fairly easy to control Crewmates&rsquo; movements.</li>
<li><strong>Security system:&nbsp;</strong>the security system on The Skeld allows the player to see four corridors at the same time, which is a great way to control what other players are doing. If you play as Impostor, you should remember that the only corridors that don&rsquo;t have security, are the two lowest ones and the very short corridor on the top right.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Danger zone:&nbsp;</strong>the Electrical room is quite dangerous for Crewmates and a good killing spot for Impostors. If you walk in to do a task and an Impostor follows you, you can&rsquo;t escape and your entrance is not recorded on the security camera. Impostors can easily flee by using the vent in the upper left corner, and they can also close the door.</li>
</ul>
