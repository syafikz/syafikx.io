<p>This is very important. If one more kill brings the number of Crewmates down to the same number as the Impostors, you have won the game! Just kill another Crewmate as quickly as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite often, Crewmates are not even aware of this. However, if they are a bit more experienced, they will try to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible to prevent the Impostor from making their final kill. The best way to fix this problem is by sabotaging immediately. During a sabotage, Crewmates can&rsquo;t call an emergency meeting and are forced to walk over to a certain spot. All you have to do is wait for them to meet their fate.</p>
