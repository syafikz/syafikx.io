<p>Talk, vote and accuse as if you were a Crewmate. Be as honest as possible about your own whereabouts, and don&rsquo;t be too aggressive. If you start yelling &ldquo;it&rsquo;s blue!&rdquo; without a good reason, others will look at you with suspicion. Even if your early game aggression leads to another players eviction, you will have drawn attention to yourself and likely be next to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Crewmates are less inclined to suspect you if they think you&rsquo;re a bit of a noob. An occasional &ldquo;who should I vote for?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the name of the room&rdquo; are subtle ways to help you achieve this. But do not exaggerate; players who continuously emphasize that this is &ldquo;my first time playing, please don&rsquo;t kill me&rdquo; are bound to get voted out.&nbsp;</p>
