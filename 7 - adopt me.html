<div class="post-header">How to get good pets? Good pets refer to the pets you really really want. <strong>There isn't really a cheat in the egg hatching system so the only thing you can do is keep hatching the eggs you want and wish for your luck</strong>. You can also trade but I'll explain it later on. When I first started out I kept asking, what's the best egg to buy? Now I think I can answer that question. You should know what pets you can get from that specific egg and decide if you want that pet. I think it' also worth it to invest in an egg where there's a higher percent chance you can get the pet you want. My advice is you should try to consider buying the temporary eggs since in the end, they will tend to be more valuable than the eggs that are always available but again, it's up to you to decide if that is a cute pet that you wanna own. Another thing. I really don't recommend buying pets or items using your bucks. You aren't protected whilst doing so. You can be scammed. No matter how much you report them, they would get away with it. I've been scammed 5 times now and I don't even look at the parties anymore. Sure there are trust worthy sellers but you can't guarantee that always. Again it's up to you if you would like to risk it.</div>
