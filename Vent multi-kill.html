<p>Much like a crowd kill, you can use your sabotaging skills to lure people away from a crime scene and keep them from reporting the body. Want to do a vent multi-kill? Start by waiting for your victim inside a vent, then kill, sabotage, and jump back in. Once Crewmates fix the sabotage and your second victim walks in, jump out and kill them before they can report the body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this will only work in early game and not for an unlimited number of times, as your absence in the emergency area may get noticed.</p>
