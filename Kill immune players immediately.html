<p>Not being able to fake certain visual tasks means that when a Crewmate completes these visual task in front of others, they are 100% in the clear. If you're the Impostor then the choice is between you and them: if they accuse you, you will lose the game. In other words, you must kill immune players as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to kill immune players quickly. Don&rsquo;t take your time and kill other Crewmates first, because that will only increase your chances of becoming the prime suspect. But don&rsquo;t be reckless either: if you&rsquo;re up against experienced Crewmates, they may be shadowing the immune player to see if the Impostor reveals himself. Use sabotage to isolate the immune player.</p>
