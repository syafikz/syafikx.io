<h1><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 1</strong></h1>
<h3 id="BoQ7HJ">You&rsquo;ll start by picking your campsite location as well as the campsite locations of the other two villagers you&rsquo;ve been handed. Pick carefully because you won&rsquo;t be able to change these locations for a while (and even then, at some significant expense).</h3>
<h3 id="cwYmud">Once you&rsquo;ve placed everyone&rsquo;s tents,&nbsp;<strong>Tom Nook</strong>&nbsp;(the big raccoon in the sweater) will give you some simple objectives (collecting Tree Branches and Fruit). Finish that and head to the party. Feel free to take a nap after this, which is when the real game will start.</h3>
<div id="div-gpt-ad-desktop_feature_body" class="dynamic-js-slot">&nbsp;</div>
<h3 id="N1gG6k">Once you wake up, you&rsquo;ll be playing in real time (meaning it will be nighttime if it&rsquo;s nighttime where you live). Make sure you speak to all of the villagers, as you may get some free&nbsp;<strong>furniture</strong>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<strong>recipe</strong>&nbsp;for being a friendly neighbor.</h3>
<h3 id="Cerl44">Nook will give you the recipes for &ldquo;flimsy&rdquo; tools. You&rsquo;ll want to make a&nbsp;<strong>Flimsy Fishing Rod</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>Flimsy Bug Net</strong>.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="iSey8x"><strong>BIG GOAL 1 &ndash; DONATE 5 FISH OR BUGS TO TOM NOOK FOR STUDY</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Use your fishing rod and net to collect the various bugs and fish you&rsquo;ll see on your island. On your first day, you&rsquo;ll only need five unique critters. After donating five, Nook will grant you an&nbsp;<strong>axe recipe</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong>watering can</strong>&nbsp;recipe. He&rsquo;ll also call his buddy,&nbsp;<strong>Blathers the Owl</strong>, and tell him to come to the island to open a museum.</h3>
<h3 id="yFT4yz"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If you are playing on a Switch with other people, only the primary account holder (the first person who started playing) can donate things to Nook. To make progress, you&rsquo;ll need that primary account holder to finish their five donations.</h3>
<h3>Decide where you want&nbsp;<strong>Blathers&rsquo; Museum</strong>&nbsp;to go. You&rsquo;ll want to pick something central as you&rsquo;ll be going there quite a bit.</h3>
<h3 id="UBwoIx">If you&rsquo;ve collected more than five creatures on your first day, make sure you save any unique finds in or around your tent. If you run out of space, you can plop items on the ground in front of your tent. Don&rsquo;t worry: They&rsquo;ll be safe. If you find two of the same creature, feel free to sell the duplicates.</h3>
<h2><strong>Big Goal 2 &ndash; Pay off Tom Nook</strong></h2>
<h3 id="D9m2G1">Tom Nook will charge you&nbsp;<strong>5,000 Nook Miles</strong>&nbsp;(or nearly 50,000 Bells) for the pleasure of moving to his island. You&rsquo;ll want to pay off this debt on the first day. It shouldn&rsquo;t be much work, as you&rsquo;ll be raking in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/20/21186746/nook-mileage-rewards-list-tasks-miles-chart-table">Nook Miles just by completing various objectives</a>&nbsp;(collecting 10 bugs, selling Clumps of Grass, etc.). You&rsquo;ll complete many of these objectives without even trying, but feel free to look through your&nbsp;<strong>Nook Phone</strong>&nbsp;to see if there are any tasks within reach.</h3>
<h3 id="gdb01T">Make sure you speak to Nook afterwards and accept his offer to build you a house, as well.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="qPlD9M"><strong>BIG GOAL 3 &ndash; INCREASE YOUR INVENTORY SPACE, AND BUY THE TOOL RING</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="PiDDcq">This is optional for Day 1, but if you plan on sinking a ton of time on launch day, you may find yourself with an abundance of Nook Miles. Head to Nook&rsquo;s tent and use the ATM-looking machine to purchase the&nbsp;<strong>Pocket Organization Guide</strong>&nbsp;for 5,000 Nook Miles. This will add another row to your inventory, which will definitely come in handy.</h4>
<div id="div-gpt-ad-desktop_feature_body_dynamic" class="dynamic-js-slot">&nbsp;</div>
<h4 id="Qw1veN">Another optional but easy-to-recommend purchase: the&nbsp;<strong>Tool Ring</strong>&nbsp;for 800 Nook Miles. This allows you to switch between tools quickly by hitting Up on the D-pad.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>BIG GOAL 4 &ndash; HARVEST RESOURCES</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="detRuN">Walk around your town and find&nbsp;<strong>four rocks</strong>. Pull out your axe and smack each of the rocks. You can hit each rock multiple times (up to eight if you&rsquo;re very quick about it) and each will spit out resources like&nbsp;<strong>Stones</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Clay</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Iron Nuggets</strong>. One of the four starting rocks will also spit out&nbsp;<strong>Bells</strong>.</h4>
<h4 id="ab18N0">Once you&rsquo;ve hit all the rocks and collected the resources, you&rsquo;ll want to harvest&nbsp;<strong>Wood</strong>. Use that same axe to hit each tree on your island three times and pick up the&nbsp;<strong>Softwood</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Hardwood</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Wood</strong>&nbsp;they drop. If your axe breaks during this process, make a new one using the&nbsp;<strong>Wooden Sticks</strong>&nbsp;you get from shaking trees.</h4>
<p id="373Mu4"><strong>Important:&nbsp;</strong>Avoid crafting anything that requires Iron Nuggets. You&rsquo;ll need 30 Iron Nuggets in the near future, and they are hard to come by in the early game.</p>
<h4 id="FZyeM8">Once you&rsquo;ve completed all of the above steps, feel free to save your game and ready yourself for Day 2.</h4>
