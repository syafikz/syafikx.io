<h2 id="0czF3l"><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 3</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Good news: Blathers&rsquo; museum is being built! Bad news: You can&rsquo;t actually donate anything while it&rsquo;s under construction, so keep your new discoveries in your house for the time being. Don&rsquo;t worry: The museum will open tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="UTkPNh"><strong>BIG GOAL 1 &ndash; FINISH THE STORE (IF YOU HAVEN&rsquo;T YET)</strong></h2>
<h4 id="ahx9vD">If you managed to collect the required resources for the Store, it&rsquo;ll be open today. If you&rsquo;re still trying to collect 30 Iron Nuggets, you&rsquo;ll undoubtedly hit that number after hitting all of your island&rsquo;s rocks on Day 3. Make sure you deliver the requested haul to Nook&rsquo;s tent, and the Store will be built on the next day.</h4>
<div id="div-gpt-ad-athena_features_desktop" class="dynamic-js-slot">&nbsp;</div>
<h4 id="TIr1Nx">And don&rsquo;t forget: If you&rsquo;re still hungry for resources, you can buy a Nook Ticket for 2,000 Nook Miles, granting you an island full of goodies.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="N4yeQR"><strong>BIG GOAL 2 &ndash; HARVEST EVEN MORE RESOURCES</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Once you turn in your 30 Iron Nuggets, you can be a little more freewheeling with that resource, which means you can make a few of the higher-end tools you have in your recipe book. This will speed up the process of collecting resources. You can never have enough resources, and you&rsquo;re going to need a boatload of them starting tomorrow.</strong></p>
