<p>Now, for the most part, ammo doesn&rsquo;t tend to be too much of an issue in&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>. Enemies are quite generous with their drops. However, certain special weapons, such as the magnum, require you to be a little pickier with your targets. They&rsquo;re boss killers and should be used as such.</p>
<p>To help with this, you can exploit a handy little trick within the weapon upgrade system. When boosting a weapon&rsquo;s capacity, the merchant will throw in a free magazine. &nbsp;If you save these upgrades for when you&rsquo;ve fired all your shots, it&rsquo;ll pay dividends.</p>
