<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Tips 5</h3>
<p>Money Making! The basic thing you could do to make money is doing tasks. I recommend being a<strong> baby pet owner as it will double your tasks.</strong> You can create families and take care of other babies. A thing I also do is I use another account and add it to my family. [You can do this if you have another device/or you can download a android emulator on pc] I become a parent and take care of my pet,other baby account, and that account's pet. You can also sell items via party and cash register [DONT SCAM/ also cash registers are not working lately, wait for the update]</p>
