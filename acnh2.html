<h2 id="dDpnjy"><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 2</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fwwu8VNx_8srJD5D5IeDnI2-d5Q=/0x0:1280x720/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1280x720):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19811779/2020030112155300_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When you wake up, you&rsquo;ll see that your tent has been upgraded to a house. Congrats! You&rsquo;re well on your way. Head to Tom Nook, who will congratulate you and give you a new mortgage for&nbsp;98,000 Bells&nbsp;for the next house upgrade. Time to get to work.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="DCrbsg"><strong>BIG GOAL 1 &ndash; DONATE 15 FISH/BUGS TO BLATHERS</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="laJrw2">If you played a lot on Day 1, you were probably able to find 15 different species of bugs and fish (not counting the five you donated to Tom Nook on the first day). If so, bring them over to&nbsp;<strong>Blathers the Owl</strong>. He&rsquo;ll give you a recipe for the&nbsp;<strong>Flimsy Shovel</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Vaulting Pole</strong>, the latter of which you can use to cross over rivers in your town.</p>

<div id="div-gpt-ad-desktop_feature_body_dynamic_1" class="dynamic-js-slot">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<p id="dyIVf5">Once you&rsquo;ve donated 15 species, you won&rsquo;t be able to donate any more, so hold any new species you find after that (and sell any duplicates).</p>
<p id="gQ5XOV">You should also have a letter from &ldquo;<strong>Mom</strong>,&rdquo; which includes three pieces of fruit that are not native to your town. Use your newly acquired shovel to dig three holes and plant the special fruit. Note that trees will only grow if there is one free space in every direction around it, so make sure the spots you pick are clear.</p>
<p id="zzqXm0">Speaking of the Flimsy Shovel, keep an eye out for&nbsp;<strong>cracked spots in the ground</strong>. Dig at these spots to find&nbsp;<strong>Fossil Pieces</strong>, which will eventually find a home with Blathers after his Museum opens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="f1VMKy"><strong>BIG GOAL 2 &ndash; COLLECT RESOURCES AGAIN!</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Repeat the resource collection process from Day 1, hitting all of the rocks and trees on your island. You can make the timing of the rock mining a little easier by digging two holes in a diagonal formation like this:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mGdaj4dtSy6pMaM0WJ-LdmZgyn8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19764452/money_rock_acnh.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stand in the corner of the two holes, and hit the rock with your shovel. The two holes will ensure that you don&rsquo;t get pushed backward and miss the rock entirely (thus giving you fewer a at it).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="cP2xnu"><strong>BIG GOAL 3 &ndash; BRING RESOURCES FOR THE STORE</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="StsIcj">If you were thorough in your resource collecting, you should have at least&nbsp;<strong>30 Softwood</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>30 Hardwood</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>30 Wood</strong>. Head into Tom Nook&rsquo;s tent and speak to&nbsp;<strong>Timmy</strong>, the little raccoon. He will mention that he&rsquo;s interested in building his own store, but he&rsquo;ll need resources to do it. Give him all 90 different pieces of Wood.</p>
<div class="m-ad m-ad__dynamic_ad_unit m-ad__desktop_feature_body" data-concert-ads-name="desktop_feature_body_dynamic">
<div id="div-gpt-ad-desktop_feature_body_dynamic_2" class="dynamic-js-slot">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<p id="VWdFrN">Unfortunately he&rsquo;s also looking for&nbsp;<strong>30 Iron Nuggets</strong>. It&rsquo;s possible you are just shy of that number, even if you collected every resource you could on both the first and second days. That&rsquo;s fine: Feel free to wait until Day 3 before turning the required resources in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="k1HV6Q"><strong>BIG GOAL 4 &ndash; USE THE NOOK TICKET</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="gG6hCs">Tom Nook will grant you a free&nbsp;<strong>Nook Ticket</strong>, which will let you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/20/21166529/nook-miles-tickets-islands">visit a randomly generated island</a>&nbsp;filled with more resources to collect. If you&rsquo;re just shy of your Iron Nuggets goal and you want to ensure the Store is built as quickly as possible, this is a good way to do it, but it&rsquo;s also totally fine if you (like us) have to wait until Day 3 before you reach 30 Iron Nuggets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="G8v9DA"><strong>Note</strong>: If the random island you visit happens to have a fruit that&rsquo;s different from your native island fruit, be sure to bring as many as you can back home. Rather than sell them, you can plant them (just as you did with the fruits from Mom). Non-native fruits sell for 500 Bells each and are a good way to make decent money early on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="5DXE8j">The Nook Island may also have an animal inhabitant who you can talk to and invite to live with you. It won&rsquo;t happen immediately, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to invite whomever you see early on to speed up the process of filling out your island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="5JI5GE"><strong>BIG GOAL 5 &ndash; BUY IMPROVED RECIPES FOR YOUR </strong><strong>TOOLS</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="iYneXy">The machine in Tom Nook&rsquo;s store sells something called&nbsp;<strong>Pretty Good Tool Recipes</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>3,000 Nook Miles</strong>. These are more durable versions of your existing tools, but they cost more resources to build (including the much-needed Iron Nuggets). Don&rsquo;t bother with any of these tools until you&rsquo;ve turned in the 30 Iron Nuggets for the store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="GlcXcw">Note: You&rsquo;ll have two new recipes for axes when you buy this recipe pack. You can build the&nbsp;<strong>Stone Axe</strong>&nbsp;without Iron Nuggets. It offers a nice durability upgrade from the Flimsy Axe, making it pretty worthwhile (but not mandatory). The&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;axe in the recipe pack looks like it&rsquo;s made out of metal and requires Iron Nuggets to build. Be careful with this second axe, as it can chop trees down in two hits. If you&rsquo;re just gathering wood from trees, just use the Stone Axe.</p>
