<h2 id="nKxxBP"><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 4</strong></h2>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 id="LlFJWr">This is going to be a big day.&nbsp;<strong>Blathers&rsquo; Museum</strong>&nbsp;is going to be fully open, which means you can take everything you&rsquo;ve been saving over to him for donation. If you&rsquo;ve already donated something, it&rsquo;ll be grayed out, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to fill your inventory with potential discoveries to see what he&rsquo;ll take. Afterward, you can sell everything that&rsquo;s grayed out.</h4>
<h4 id="bcL4SJ">Where do you sell it? Timmy and Tommy&rsquo;s Store, of course!&nbsp;<strong>Nook&rsquo;s Cranny</strong>&nbsp;will be your new shopping destination for new&nbsp;<strong>furniture</strong>. You can also sell off unneeded items and check the board in front of the store for an in demand item that sells for far more than normal.</h4>

<h3 id="7PU8vW"><strong>BIG GOAL 1 &ndash; BUILD A BRIDGE</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="UG1SK6">Talk to Tom Nook, who will mention that there are new people interested in moving to your island. But first he wants to make sure there&rsquo;s enough space for them. He&rsquo;ll give you a recipe for a&nbsp;<strong>Wooden Bridge</strong>, which will make traveling across a single river far easier. It&rsquo;ll require a handful of Wood to create the components, but you&rsquo;ve been harvesting every day, right? So you should be fine!</h4>
<div id="div-gpt-ad-athena_features_desktop_1" class="dynamic-js-slot">&nbsp;</div>
<h4 id="BtkyKp">Think long and hard about the placement of your first bridge, though. While the first bridge is free, subsequent bridges will cost a lot of Bells, so make this one count. Put it somewhere that you think will get the most use based on your island layout.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="lXyzTS"><strong>BIG GOAL 2 &ndash; SELECT THREE HOUSING PLOTS</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="4o1gNO">After you plop down your bridge, Nook will give you three housing plots. Unlike the plots you selected for your tents on Day 1, these plots are enormous because they include the house and a surrounding lawn.</h4>
<h4 id="gsuC8D">We&rsquo;d recommend placing them somewhat close to each other, for convenience sake, but in the long run their positioning won&rsquo;t make a huge difference, so don&rsquo;t stress about it.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="YYWZ3u"><strong>BIG GOAL 3 &ndash; BUILD FURNITURE FOR YOUR PLOTS</strong></h3>
<h4 id="aqW60H">Each of the three plots requires six pieces of furniture &mdash; three inside and three outside. All of the furniture requested for the plots is DIY furniture, meaning you can craft it using common materials. You&rsquo;ve been harvesting every day, right? If so, you should have plenty of resources to finish each of the plots today. If you don&rsquo;t, you can always purchase a Nook Ticket for more Wood, Iron Nuggets, Stones, or Clay.</h4>
<h4 id="C911mx">When you place the second plot, you&rsquo;ll unlock the recipe for the&nbsp;<strong>Ladder</strong>, which you can use to climb the steep cliffs on your island. You&rsquo;ll need to snag the&nbsp;<strong>flowers</strong>&nbsp;that are up there for one of the furniture requests, but while you&rsquo;re up there, keep an eye out for&nbsp;<strong>fossils</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>bugs</strong>&nbsp;that you haven&rsquo;t found yet.</h4>
<h4 id="YlJtmJ">Once you&rsquo;ve finished all of the requests, speak to Tom Nook and let him know the job is done. You&rsquo;ll have new villagers soon!</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="k921oq"><strong>BIG GOAL 4 &ndash; HARVEST MORE RESOURCES</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>You know what to do!</strong></h4>
