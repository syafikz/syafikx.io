<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Tip 1: Taking Care of Babies and Pets</h3>
<p>This is pretty straight forward. If you be a baby, you can get double the money taking care of you and your pet. By just taking care of you and your pet, you can get a pretty big amount of money, especially if you are working on making a neon pet. When I make a neon pet, I am usually able to buy 4 jungle/safari/farm eggs with the money I got. So that totals up to be 3000 Bucks! But I am never usually a baby, so that would be double the money and total up to be 6000 Bucks! And if you want a little more money, offer to take care of your friend's pets or start a daycare!</p>
