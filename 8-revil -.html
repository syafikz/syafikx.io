<p><strong>Early in the game, those dynamite ganados sure can be deadly enemies. Should you get yourself caught in a blast, they&rsquo;ll deal absurd damage to Leon, potentially killing him outright. They&rsquo;re the bane of inexperienced players.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, those who have mastered Resident Evil 4 often see these enemies as a huge help rather than a hindrance. They&rsquo;re just as dangerous to their fellow ganados as they are to you, and with a little luring, you can lead dynamite ganados to wipe out waves of their allies without you even having to fire a shot.</strong></p>
