<p>This office map is the smallest in the game with 12 rooms of all shapes and sizes and no clear structure the layout. The key thing to look out for are the single vent system, some isolated sabotage locations and the Doorlog, which replaces cameras and makes it easier for the Impostor to sneak around.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The structure:&nbsp;</strong>Mira HQ&rsquo;s structure is complex with some rooms very close to each other, and others isolated at the end of a long corridor. Because of its size and density, Crewmates will have a big advantage if they stay together.</li>
<li><strong>The vent system:&nbsp;</strong>the 11 vents on Mira HQ are equally scattered across the map. Only the area around Communications has less vents. The difference with other maps, and a great advantage for Impostors, is that all vents are connected in one system.</li>
<li><strong>Visual tasks:&nbsp;</strong>unfortunately for Crewmates, there is only one visual task on this map: the scan in MedBay.</li>
<li><strong>Sabotage locations:&nbsp;</strong>the three sabotage locations are at the top right and in the middle of the map. That means that an Impostor can easily lure a Crewmate out of the left and bottom right areas. There are no doors to lock on this map.</li>
<li><strong>Security system:&nbsp;</strong>instead of security cameras, this map has a unique feature called the &lsquo;Doorlog&rsquo;. The Doorlog keeps a record with up to 20 entries of the players who pass one of three sensors in the top right corridor. That also means that the Doorlog only gives information about this particular part of the map. Overall, the Impostor has to be far less worried that someone might be spying on him.</li>
<li><strong>Danger zone:&nbsp;</strong>the doors of the Decontamination corridor will close temporarily upon entrance. If you enter as a Crewmate together with an Impostor&hellip; Well, you will probably not leave Decontamination alive. The Impostor will be able to come and go through the vent.</li>
