<p>&nbsp;A splendid way to get more pets is very simple. If you are a beginner, go get your starter pet in the Nursery. Once you hatch that by completing tasks for the egg, use the pet you got from it to earn yourself some money. Once you get to at least 350 Bucks, all you have to do is buy a cracked egg, hatch that, then use one of your pets, and repeat the process until you want to buy a different egg, get the right amount of money, then repeat again.</p>
