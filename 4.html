<li>Now, go to the track with the train car. It stops inside buildings - this wat, you can exit and steer it. Stop it as it is shown above. This is the room you have visited before (from here, you jumped into the room where you turned the train on). Apart from stopping the train, you need to put boxes and an armchair in front of it.</li>

<ol>
<li>Next to the hatch there is the roof from which you can walk on the pipe to then jump to the building visible above.
