<h2 id="01btjj"><strong>WHAT TO DO ON DAY 5</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="tzFeX1">If you&rsquo;ve been following this guide, Day 5 in&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>&nbsp;is going to be a bit slow. There are really only two major events to take note of.</p>
<p id="Cr9Xvu">Firstly, your Wooden Bridge will be completed. Unfortunately you won&rsquo;t be able to build any more bridges for a little while, but at least that&rsquo;ll make one river crossing easier for now. You can talk to Nook and attend the opening ceremony, but it&rsquo;s optional.</p>
<h3 id="sD1P9P"><strong>BIG GOAL 1 &ndash; MEET YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR</strong></h3>
<p id="EFQQxg">The other notable thing on Day 5: You&rsquo;ll have a new inhabitant on your island! Walk over to their newly built house and have a chat. You won&rsquo;t get much out of it, but it&rsquo;s always a good idea to introduce yourself.</p>
<h3 id="DoLbtb"><strong>BIG GOAL 2 &ndash; LEARN HOW TO CUSTOMIZE FURNITURE</strong></h3>
<p id="nR8d7a">Tom Nook will teach you how to customize furniture and other DIY projects via a seminar in his tent. Take his class, and it&rsquo;ll open a wide variety of visual customizations for your furniture and tools.</p>
<h3 id="wyC7Pm"><strong>BIG GOAL 3 &ndash; HARVEST MORE RESOURCES</strong></h3>
<p id="O6bOUU">By this point you&rsquo;re likely drowning in Hardwood, Softwood, and Wood. If you feel like you&rsquo;ve got plenty, feel free to skip the day hitting all the trees around your town, if only to save your sanity. That said, it&rsquo;s always good to hit all of your rocks for Iron Nuggets, Stones, and more, as these resources can be a bit hard to come by. You may even score a&nbsp;<strong>Golden Nugget</strong>&nbsp;in the process. If you do, save it for later.</p>
