<p>We&rsquo;re not saying that this is the most honorable way to win, but it is an entertaining one. Just stand still and wait. Others will notice you&rsquo;re not moving, assume you&rsquo;re AFK, and leave you alone. When a player comes in range, walk towards them and quickly kill them. Then go back to the exact same spot you were in. You will be surprised how many players buy into this tactic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is unlikely to work a second time in the same group of players. But if you&rsquo;re playing with a group of friends and want to make memories that last a lifetime&hellip; Being the ultimate Impostor-troll is the way to do it.</p>
