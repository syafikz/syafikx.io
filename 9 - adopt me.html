<p>&nbsp;Is spending Robux on Adopt me! worth it?<strong> I honestly haven't bought anything on adopt me with robux and still I got a Fly Ride Frost Dragon :p. </strong>I've been told VIP is meh. Houses are okay but if you went to adopt me just to purchase the robux house then you should've just played Bloxburg. Adopt Me! things that cost robux are so expensive! (Especially Ninja Legends WTF...) I don't really think an online game is worth spending on. But then again, if you really enjoy it and think it's worth it, it's up to you! If you are considering buying the ride or fly potions I think you should just wait as many people like to trade their potions for legendaries. That's how I got mine anyways. So if you have an extra legendary from your eggs, just trade it for potions. The Food and drink stands are "okay". I didn't buy them but I got one from a trade. The Ice Cream Truck is a waste of robux. No one will buy any ice cream from you if it costs 5bucks+ but lowering the price of the ice cream also isn't really ideal since 1 buck every time, the total isn't worth the robux. You can also get free apples from the School anyways!</p>
