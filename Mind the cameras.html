<p>Impostors often overlook the presence of cameras on the Skeld and Polus maps. A Crewmate watching the cameras might see you stab someone, so beware. You can see several cameras hanging on the walls of both maps. If you see a blinking red light, you know someone is watching you. So don&rsquo;t stab the next Crewmate that comes along.</p>
<p>The cameras are not just there to hinder you though. Crewmates watching the cameras can&rsquo;t see other players next to them, so if you see those little red lights, it may be time to pay the security room a visit. Furthermore, you can pretend to be a Crewmate by watching the cameras yourself.</p>
