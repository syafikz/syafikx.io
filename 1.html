<div class="bpic"><img src="https://guides.gamepressure.com/hello_neighbor/gfx/word/613470718.jpg" alt="10 - Hello Neighbor: Act 1 | Walkthrough - Walkthrough - Hello Neighbor Game Guide" /></div>

In the meantime, you have to quickly get on the platform - you have to reach it before the item moves the lever.</li>
