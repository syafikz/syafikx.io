<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Tips 7</h3>
<p>Trading tips. In trading, you can trade your items to other players for other items. You can't really go wrong in trading but<strong> before you click accept, think first if it's worth it or that you wouldn't regret it in the long run. </strong>Because they can easily leave the game and your pet will be gone forever. STAY AWAY FROM TRUST TRADES. Yes, a very small percentage of trust traders are quite honest but MOST are NOT. This is just a tactic to get your beloved pets. Don't Do This Please. A "fair" trade can mean nothing to be honest. As long as you really want something, and you don't care about the item you are trading then it's a done deal. I once got scolded by my brother for trading my penguin for a Pig. I don't regret it at all because all that's on my mind was "now I have Hawk from seven deadly sins".</p>
