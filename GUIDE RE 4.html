<p>The Mercenaries is a bonus mode within the game, an arcade affair that sees you dispatching waves of enemies across familiar&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>&nbsp;locales (and one that isn&rsquo;t) for high scores. Each stage is inhabited by a miniboss exclusive to that area, all of whom are very dangerous and can end your run in a flash if you aren&rsquo;t careful.</p>
<p>You probably know that Krauser can one-shot any of them with a simple use of his arm transformation attack. However, you may not be aware that HUNK can do the same thing to the Bella Sisters, the minibosses in the village. All you have to do is stun them with a headshot or flash grenade, then run up and perform your Neckbreaker melee attack. They&rsquo;re the only miniboss this trick works on, so it&rsquo;s very niche, but it sure is satisfying!</p>
