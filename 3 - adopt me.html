<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Tip 3: Stay Online</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Staying online can help you get money. Every so often, you will be given 20 Bucks for just being on the&nbsp;<em>Adopt Me!</em>&nbsp;game! So, if you want to do something else but earn money at the same time, just stay online. You don't have to do anything, even move. But check back every so often, and make sure not to stay idle for a bit because ROBLOX will kick you off the game if you do.</p>
