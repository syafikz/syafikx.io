<p>&lsquo;Polus&rsquo; is a large, snowy planet with 15 rooms. Walking around this map is a little different the others, as it features a large, open space in the middle.&nbsp;It means in certain places Impostors can escape in almost any direction after doing something. This also has a system to let players check who's dead or alive remotely.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The structure:&nbsp;</strong>two areas on the east and west side are connected by corridors and rooms. The middle part, on the other hand, is completely open with a few &lsquo;loose&rsquo; rooms. Your mobility is therefore influenced depending on where you are on this map. If you&rsquo;re an Imposer who decides to kill in the Specimen room, know that you will have to leave through a long corridor and a decontamination room. Make a kill next to the Storage room, on the other hand, and you can walk away in any direction you want.</li>
<li><strong>The vent system:&nbsp;</strong>technically, there aren&rsquo;t any vents; just holes in the ground. There are 12 of them, divided into four connected systems. While some of them are almost next to each other, others are very far apart. Note that the right part of the map and the lower left don&rsquo;t have vents. If we separate the upper and lower half of the map, we see that the lower half only has four vents, and the upper half has eight. As a result, the Imposer might stick more to the upper parts.</li>
<li><strong>Visual tasks:&nbsp;</strong>Polus has two visual tasks, a scan and an asteroid shooter.</li>
<li><strong>Sabotage locations:&nbsp;</strong>there are three sabotage locations, plus the option to close doors. None of these are located in the lower right corner, which means that Crewmates are a bit safer there but have to run far to fix emergencies. Also important: a Crewmember can open a closed door by themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Security system:&nbsp;</strong>like The Skeld, Polus has a security system. This map has six large areas under camera surveillance, but you can only see one at a time. To help you memorize where they are located: there is a camera on every exit of the large east and west wings, plus one in the middle of the map.</li>
<li><strong>Decontamination rooms:&nbsp;</strong>beware of the small decontamination rooms that will temporarily lock you up.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Vitals:&nbsp;</strong>this unique feature allows players to check who is alive and who is not. The Vitals can be found in the room on the right side of the Office</li>
