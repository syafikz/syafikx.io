<p>If you&rsquo;ve played through the game, you&rsquo;ll have surely noticed that Jack Krauser, Leon&rsquo;s former-ally-turned-foe, is pretty darn handy with a knife. He&rsquo;s an agent experienced with all manner of firearms and other weapons, but the simple knife seems to be his favorite.</p>
<p>The game&rsquo;s trying to tell you something here. In the later stages of the game, you&rsquo;ll engage in a super-dramatic boss battle with Krauser. When he breaks out his trump card, that absurd, mutated, blade-like extend-o-claw of his, you wouldn&rsquo;t think of falling back on your own knife, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how very effective it is on him, staggering him and dealing huge damage. It&rsquo;s tough to pull off, with his range and the cramped area on top of the tower working against you, but you&rsquo;ll put him down in seconds this way.</p>
