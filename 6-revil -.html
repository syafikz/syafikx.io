<div><strong>In games that take themselves super-seriously sometimes, with their gore, adult content and&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/plot-holes-resident-evil-never-explained/">nonsensical plotlines,</a>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s fun to unlock a costume that&rsquo;s just a little out there. Leon&rsquo;s 1930s gangster outfit, complete with fedora? You&rsquo;d better believe we&rsquo;re down with that.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>As a bonus, choosing this costume when starting a new playthrough will also outfit Ashley in a suit of armor. Not only does this look similarly ridiculous, but it also serves a practical purpose in the game! In her armor, Ashley is completely impervious to just about all damage, and she&rsquo;s too heavy for enemies to carry away. The best part? They still try to do so, which treats the player to a comical animation where they buckle under her weight and drop her. True experts know how to utilize this invincible Ashley as bait to prevent Leon being swarmed.</strong></div>
